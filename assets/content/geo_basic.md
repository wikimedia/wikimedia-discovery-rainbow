Geographic Search API usage
=======

Geo Search, or Geographic Search, refers to the ability to search for pages that are "near" a particular set of geographic coordinates,
in the sense of being about subjects that have physical locations we track.

(places. Not people.)

General trends
------

It's early days, but the tiny adoption of Geographic Search, particularly compared to Cirrus or OpenSearch, suggests this isn't a tremendously useful feature to API users. We need to dig in and refine the heuristics for identifying requests as different types,
however.

Outages and inaccuracies
------

  * None so far!
