Geographic Search API usage
=======

Geo Search, or Geographic Search, refers to the ability to search for pages that are "near" a particular set of geographic coordinates, in the sense of being about subjects that have physical locations we track. (places. Not people.)

General trends
------

It's early days, but the tiny adoption of Geographic Search, particularly compared to Cirrus or OpenSearch, suggests this isn't a tremendously useful feature to API users. We need to dig in and refine the heuristics for identifying requests as different types, however.

Outages and inaccuracies
------

* '__R__': on 2017-01-01 we started calculating all of Discovery's metrics using a new version of [our data retrieval and processing codebase](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/WDGO/) that we migrated to [Wikimedia Analytics](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Analytics)' [Reportupdater infrastructure](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Reportupdater). See [T150915](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T150915) for more details. Furthermore, we switched to an updated UDF for counting API calls -- the previous version was undercounting full-text and geo search API calls (see [Gerrit change 315503](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/315503/) for more details).
