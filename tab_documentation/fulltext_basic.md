Full-text Search via API usage
=======

What we're talking about is "full text" search; searching for a particular
term via the API and getting back packages that contain that term in either the title *or* the page's content.

General trends
------

There's not enough data to be able to say much about the patterns inherrent to Full-text Search (via API) usage right now, but it's interesting to compare the values found to how much other search API forms are used. Full-text sits near the top of the pack; Open Search is used dramatically more, but everything else somewhat (or very much) less.

Outages and inaccuracies
------

* None so far!
