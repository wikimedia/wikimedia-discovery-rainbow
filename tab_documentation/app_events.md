Mobile App search
=======

User actions that we track around search on the mobile apps generally fall into three categories:

1. The start of a user's search session;
2. The presentation of the user with a results page, and;
3. A user clicking through to an article in the results page.

These three things are tracked via the [EventLogging 'MobileWikiAppSearch' schema](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schema:MobileWikiAppSearch), and stored to a database. The results are then aggregated and anonymised, and presented on this page. For performance/privacy reasons we randomly sample what we store, so the actual numbers are a vast understatement of how many user actions our servers receive - what's more interesting is how they change over time. In the case of app search, this sampling rate is **1%**.

Due to a bug in the iOS EventLogging system, iOS events are currently being tracked much more frequently than Android ones and so are displayed in a different graph to avoid confusion.
