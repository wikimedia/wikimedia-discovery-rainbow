Usage and Zero Results Rate by Languages and Projects
=======

Sometimes, searches return zero results. What we're visualising here is the percentage of the time
a search query returns zero results, split out by language (e.g. English vs Russian) and project (e.g. Wikipedia vs Wiktionary).

Notes/Tips
------
* The percentages next to the language and project names represent the proportion of the total volume.
* You can select multiple projects and multiple languages to compare simultaneously. (Hold down Ctrl on Windows or Command on Mac.)
* For each arbitrary combination, the zero results rate is the overall rate (full-text AND prefix, web AND api).
* The language picker will automatically choose "(None)" if you select a non-multilingual project such as Wikidata.
* If you're interested in the overall ZRR for a multilingual project such as Wikipedia, make sure only "(None)" is selected in the languages picker.
* Due to the high number of language-project combinations, we have restricted ourselves to only storing the last 30 days of data.

Outages and inaccuracies
------
* On 15 January 2016 there was an [issue](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T123541) with Avro serialization that prevented data from entering the Hadoop cluster. A [patch](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/264989/) was deployed on 19 January 2016. As a result, there are no recorded zero results rates for 01/15-01/19. The values you may see on those dates are estimates computed with [statistical models](https://github.com/bearloga/branch/blob/master/zero%20results%20rate%20estimation/report.pdf).
