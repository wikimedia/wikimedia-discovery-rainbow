Breakdown by Languages and Projects
=======

On this page, we split out several metrics by language (e.g. English vs Russian) and project (e.g. Wikipedia vs Wiktionary) to help us understand the differences between wikis. See the following pages for more details on how we compute these metrics:
 
 - [Augmented Clickthrough](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/metrics/#kpi_augmented_clickthroughs)
 - [Desktop Events](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/metrics/#desktop_events)
 - [Paulscore](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/metrics/#paulscore_approx)
 - [Zero Results](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/metrics/#failure_rate)

Notes/Tips
------
* The percentages next to the language and project names represent the proportion of the total volume.
* You can select multiple projects and multiple languages to compare simultaneously. (Hold down Ctrl on Windows or Command on Mac.)
* For each arbitrary combination, the zero results rate is the overall rate (full-text AND prefix, web AND api).
* The language picker will automatically choose "(None)" if you select a non-multilingual project such as Wikidata.
* If you're interested in the overall metric for a multilingual project such as Wikipedia, make sure only "(None)" is selected in the languages picker.
* Due to the high number of language-project combinations, we have restricted ourselves to only storing the last 30 days of data.
