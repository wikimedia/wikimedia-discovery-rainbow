<h1>PaulScore Approximations</h1>

<p>"PaulScore" is the name we've given to a metric proposed by Paul Nelson in a talk he gave at <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ_amC9gZmk&t=16m38s" title = "Paul Nelson's talk at Elasticon">Elasticon</a>. We use PaulScore to evaluate the quality of results provided by CirrusSearch or proposed modifications to CirrusSearch, based on historical click data. A big advantage of the PaulScore is that it relies on user click history to award points, so it is easy to compute.</p>
<p>This dashboard shows the PaulScore approximation for 3 values of $F$: 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9. The maximum score possible for each value of $F$ is $1/(1-F)$, so the dashboard has the option of looking at relative PaulScores, which is the computed value divided by maximum possible value for given $F$.</p>
<p>For auto-completion suggestions, we expect a much lower score since most queries get no clicks -- i.e., while typing many results are shown and ignored -- and most users will only click on one results, whereas full-text searchers can more easily go back to the results page or open multiple results in other windows.</p>

<p>PaulScore is computed via the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick scoring factor $0 < F < 1$.</li>
<li>For $i$-th search session $S_i$ $(i = 1, \ldots, n)$ containing $m$ queries $Q_1, \ldots, Q_m$ and search result sets $\mathbf{R}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{R}_m$: <ol>
    <li>For each $j$-th search query $Q_j$ with result set $\mathbf{R}_j$, let $\nu_j$ be the query score: $$\nu_j = \sum_{k~\in~\{\text{0-based positions of clicked results in}~\mathbf{R}_j\}} F^k.$$</li>
    <li>Let user's average query score $\bar{\nu}_{(i)}$ be $$\bar{\nu}_{(i)} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j = 1}^m \nu_j.$$</li>
  </ol></li>
<li>Then the PaulScore is the average of all users' average query scores: $$\text{PaulScore}~=~\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \bar{\nu}_{(i)}.$$</li>
</ol>
